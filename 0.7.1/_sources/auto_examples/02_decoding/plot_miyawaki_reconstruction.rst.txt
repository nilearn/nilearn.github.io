Reconstruction of visual stimuli from Miyawaki et al. 2008
==========================================================

This example reproduces the experiment presented in
    `Visual image reconstruction from human brain activity
    using a combination of multiscale local image decoders
    <http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273%2808%2900958-6>`_,
    Miyawaki, Y., Uchida, H., Yamashita, O., Sato, M. A.,
    Morito, Y., Tanabe, H. C., ... & Kamitani, Y. (2008).
    Neuron, 60(5), 915-929.

It reconstructs 10x10 binary images from functional MRI data. Random images
are used as training set and structured images are used for reconstruction.

The code is a bit elaborate as the example uses, as the original article,
a multiscale prediction on the images seen by the subject.

See also
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_02_decoding_plot_miyawaki_encoding.py` for a
encoding approach for the same dataset.
