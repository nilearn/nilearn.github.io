ROI-based decoding analysis in Haxby et al. dataset
===================================================

In this script we reproduce the data analysis conducted by
Haxby et al. in "Distributed and Overlapping Representations of Faces and
Objects in Ventral Temporal Cortex".

Specifically, we look at decoding accuracy for different objects in
three different masks: the full ventral stream (mask_vt), the house
selective areas (mask_house) and the face selective areas (mask_face),
that have been defined via a standard GLM-based analysis.
