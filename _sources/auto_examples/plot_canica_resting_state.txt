Group analysis of resting-state fMRI with ICA: CanICA
=====================================================

An example applying CanICA to resting-state data. This example applies it
to 40 subjects of the ADHD200 datasets.

CanICA is an ICA method for group-level analysis of fMRI data. Compared
to other strategies, it brings a well-controlled group model, as well as a
thresholding algorithm controlling for specificity and sensitivity with
an explicit model of the signal. The reference papers are:

      fMRI datasets", NeuroImage Vol 51 (2010), p. 288-299

    * G. Varoquaux et al. "ICA-based sparse features recovery from fMRI
      datasets", IEEE ISBI 2010, p. 1177
