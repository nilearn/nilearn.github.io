Massively univariate analysis of face vs house recognition
==========================================================

A permuted Ordinary Least Squares algorithm is run at each voxel in
order to detemine whether or not it behaves differently under a "face
viewing" condition and a "house viewing" condition.
We consider the mean image per session and per condition.
Otherwise, the observations cannot be exchanged at random because
a time dependance exists between observations within a same session
(see [1] for more detailed explanations).

The example shows the small differences that exist between
Bonferroni-corrected p-values and family-wise corrected p-values obtained
from a permutation test combined with a max-type procedure [2].
Bonferroni correction is a bit conservative, as revealed by the presence of
a few false negative.
