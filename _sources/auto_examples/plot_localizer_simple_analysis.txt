Massively univariate analysis of a calculation task from the Localizer dataset
==============================================================================

This example shows how to use the Localizer dataset in a basic analysis.
A standard Anova is performed (massively univariate F-test) and the resulting
Bonferroni-corrected p-values are plotted.
We use a calculation task and 20 subjects out of the 94 available.

The Localizer dataset contains many contrasts and subject-related
variates.  The user can refer to the
`plot_localizer_mass_univariate_methods.py` example to see how to use these.
