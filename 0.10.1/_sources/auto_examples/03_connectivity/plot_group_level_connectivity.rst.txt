Classification of age groups using functional connectivity
==========================================================

This example compares different kinds of functional connectivity between
regions of interest : correlation, partial correlation, and tangent space
embedding.

The resulting connectivity coefficients can be used to
discriminate children from adults. In general, the tangent space embedding
**outperforms** the standard correlations: see `Dadi et al 2019
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919301594>`_
for a careful study.

Load brain development fMRI dataset and MSDL atlas

Region signals extraction
-------------------------
To extract regions time series, we instantiate a
:class:`nilearn.maskers.NiftiMapsMasker` object and pass the atlas the
file name to it, as well as filtering band-width and detrending option.

This is a small example to showcase nilearn features. In practice such
comparisons need to be performed on much larger cohorts and several
datasets.
