ROI-based decoding analysis in Haxby et al. dataset
===================================================

In this script we reproduce the data analysis
conducted by :footcite:t:`Haxby2001`.

Specifically, we look at decoding accuracy for different objects in
three different masks: the full ventral stream (mask_vt), the house
selective areas (mask_house) and the face selective areas (mask_face),
that have been defined via a standard GLM-based analysis.

Decoding on the different masks
