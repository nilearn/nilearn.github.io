Single-subject data (two runs) in native space
==============================================

The example shows the analysis of an :term:`SPM` dataset,
with two conditions: viewing a face image or a scrambled face image.

This example takes a lot of time because the input are lists of 3D images
sampled in different positions (encoded by different affine functions).

    Computing contrasts

We actually want more interesting contrasts.
The simplest contrast just makes the difference
between the two main conditions.
We define the two opposite versions to run one-tailed t-tests.

Let's store common parameters for all plots.

We plot the contrasts values overlaid on the mean fMRI image
and we will use the z-score values as transparency,
with any voxel with | Z-score | > 3 being fully opaque
and any voxel with 0 < | Z-score | < 1.96 being partly transparent.

Based on the resulting maps we observe
that the analysis results in wide activity
for the 'effects of interest' contrast,
showing the implications of large portions of the visual cortex
in the conditions.
By contrast,
the differential effect between "faces" and "scrambled" involves sparser,
more anterior and lateral regions.
It also displays some responses in the frontal lobe.
