NeuroVault cross-study ICA maps.
================================

This example shows how to download statistical maps from
NeuroVault, label them with NeuroSynth terms,
and compute :term:`ICA` components across all the maps.

See :func:`nilearn.datasets.fetch_neurovault`
documentation for more details.
