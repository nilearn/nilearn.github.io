Functional connectivity predicts age group
==========================================

This example compares different kinds of :term:`functional connectivity`
between regions of interest : correlation, partial correlation,
and tangent space embedding.

The resulting connectivity coefficients can be used to
discriminate children from adults. In general, the tangent space embedding
**outperforms** the standard correlations:
see :footcite:t:`Dadi2019` for a careful study.

This is a small example to showcase nilearn features. In practice such
comparisons need to be performed on much larger cohorts and several
datasets.
:footcite:t:`Dadi2019` showed
that across many cohorts and clinical questions,
the tangent kind should be preferred.
