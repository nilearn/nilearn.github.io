Functional connectivity predicts age group
==========================================

This example compares different kinds of functional connectivity between
regions of interest : correlation, partial correlation, and tangent space
embedding.

The resulting connectivity coefficients can be used to
discriminate children from adults. In general, the tangent space embedding
**outperforms** the standard correlations: see `Dadi et al 2019
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919301594>`_
for a careful study.

What kind of connectivity is most powerful for classification?
--------------------------------------------------------------
we will use connectivity matrices as features to distinguish children from
adults. We use cross-validation and measure classification accuracy to
compare the different kinds of connectivity matrices.

        [('connectivity', ConnectivityMeasure(vectorize=True)),
         ('classifier', GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(), {'C': [.1, 1., 10.]}, cv=5))])

We use random splits of the subjects into training/testing sets.
StratifiedShuffleSplit allows preserving the proportion of children in the
test set.

This is a small example to showcase nilearn features. In practice such
comparisons need to be performed on much larger cohorts and several
datasets.
`Dadi et al 2019

Showed that across many cohorts and clinical questions, the tangent
kind should be preferred.
